# Tech-Blog-MVC

## Description
This application is designed to be a blog-style object-oriented-programming MVC(model, view, controller). The application is designed to run on both the front-end and back-end using the MVC paradigm. Once initialized, a user will be able to login to add blog posts to the dashboard where they can also see other users blog posts. The application utilizes MySql databases to create models, handlebars to deploy the views, and JavaScript to handle the routes for the controllers.  I was inspired to build this project to give people the ability to write and update blog posts in a CMS style so they can publish articles, and their thoughts and opinions.

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "tech-blog-mvc" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

You can also open this environment through Heroku using the link at the bottom of this readme.

## Usage

You may use this to publish articles, blog posts, or any thoughts or opinions in a blog-style format. When the application is opened, you must first navigate to the login screen and create an account. Upon entering the right information, you will be able to create a blog post by clicking the "Create A New Blog" button, which pops up a screen to enter a title and text for your blog. Once you have created it, you can see it displayed in your dashboard, where you can edit and delete it as well. When clicking the homepage, you can see what other users have posted. You can then logout and still view the users' blog posts.
